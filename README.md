This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This contains all the code, content and examples that make up the developer portal of OpenEPI.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Code examples

When adding code examples, add a folder to the root code-examples folder
After the files are added, you can run `npm run build:codeExamples` and a component will be available in app/code-examples

If you are introducing a new language, please update the import_code_examples.js in the root folder, and register a new syntax in CodeBlock.tsx
